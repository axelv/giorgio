# Giorgio

Giorgio will help you serizalize your background tasks so you can rum them on another machine or use them for provenance and lineage. Tasks are idempotent and can have dependencies which make them suiteable for data pipelines.
Giorgio is strongly inspired by [Luigi](https://luigi.readthedocs.io) but encourages typing and integrates well with state-of-the-art workflow managers and data pipeline frameworks.

We strongly advice you to go through the **examples** where you will learn how you can adopt this library incrementally and keep dependcies on external libraries as minimal as possible.
